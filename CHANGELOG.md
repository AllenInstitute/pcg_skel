This project is under active development and, while breaking changes will be avoided where possible, no promises are made until version 1 is released.

## [0.0.2] - 2021-02-13

### Added

* *Localizing level 2 ids via segmentation if the mesh does not exist.*
There are both expected and unexpected an unexpected reasons for mesh fragments not to exist.
Unfortunately, this situation seems to crop up for virtually every neuron.
However, all level 2 ids must be associated with at least one supervoxel, so we can use the segmentation itself to do the same operation.
This is a bit slower, since we have to download the whole chunk, but it's a robust fallback that can be used when no mesh is found.
This is now used by default, but can be turned off with `segmentation_fallback=False` on any of the functions that use level 2 positions.

* *Improved parallelization.*
To speed up the slow segmentation fallback, parallelization occurs in more processing steps.
